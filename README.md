## Time Allotment Breakdown

## Intro & Instructions-5 minutes.

Activity 1: Variables & Functions 15 minutes.
Activity 2: DOM Manipulation-20 minutes
Activity 3: Debugging & Enhancement - 15 minutes
Submission & Reflection 5 minutes

## Materials/Setup

Any modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge).
Text editor (VS Code recommended),
Starter files or create from scratch (index.html, script.js).
Stable internet (for documentation lookups if needed).

## Instructions to Students

Work individually. Follow each activity and test your code in the browser console. Save your work frequently.

## Activity 1: Variables and Functions (15 min)
Create an HTML file and link a JS script. Declare variables name and age. Write a function greetUser(name, age) that returns a formatted string. Log the result.

index.html
script.js

## Expected console output:
Hello, I am Ailen and I am 30 years old.

## Activity 2: DOM Manipulation (20 min)

Add a button that changes the background color randomly when clicked. Alse display the chosen color in a paragraph element.
index.html (add inside <body>)
script.js (append):
Expected behavior: Clicking the button changes the background and shows the hex code.

## Activity 3: Debugging and Enhancement (15 min)

Use console.log to trace values before and after color change. Enhance logs to include a friendly message.
script.js (append):

Expected console output example:

## Submission Instructions (Google Classroom)

Push two files: lastname js lab.html and lastname_js_lab.js.
Ensure Activity 1-3 code is present and runs in the browser without errors.
Add a short note in the private comment: What did you learn or debug today? (1-2 sentences).
